<!-- How to fix "NO SHOW IMAGES" in HTML pages when using WORDPRESS-TO-HTML plugin -->
Usual fix when there is a new website revamp exported using WORDPRESS-TO-HTML plugin (TAKE NOTE: after export, 
all images are not showing on live page like MY images and Recent Projects)

Go to your Index/Homepage text editor and find your staging site URL PATHs

1. For My original images link path: located on jaysonweb.site/index.html
> From: http://portfolio-staging-v2/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Profile-December-2025.jpg
> To: images/2026/Profile-December-2025.jpg

2. Recent Projects: located on jaysonweb.site/css/elementor-css-post-699.css
> From: http://localhost:10011/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fbr1.jpg 
> To: ../images/2026/fbr1.jpg
